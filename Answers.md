1. What problem does the context API help solve?

~ state management, it aims to avoid props drilling.

1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store
   known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

~ store contains all of the state in your app. Just learn this, Actions are more like controllers in MVC where you want something to happen in your app and then Reducer is the model, where it is the holding current state of the application.

1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

~ application state is global and component state is local.

1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

~ redux thunk allows the action to return a function instead of an action

1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

~ Redux!!! idk why people hate it but i seems like to love it.. lol idk why.. I just love all the state is in 1 store.. that's just me..
